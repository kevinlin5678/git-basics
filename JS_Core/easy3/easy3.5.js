/*
Write a function that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument and logs a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

Examples:

triangle(5);

    *
   **
  ***
 ****

triangle(9);

        *
       **
      ***

//my answer
function triangle(num) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    console.log(' '.repeat(num - i) + '*'.repeat(i))
  }
}

triangle(20);

//SOLUTION
function triangle(height) {
  let spaces = height - 1;
  let stars = 1;
  while (height > 0) {
    console.log(`${" ".repeat(spaces)}${"*".repeat(stars)}`);
    spaces -= 1;
    stars += 1;
    height -= 1;
  }
}

/*
For this problem, there is an inverse relationship between the number of spaces and the number of stars included on each line. 
The first line includes height - 1 spaces and 1 star. The second line includes height - 2 spaces and 2 stars. The remaining lines all follow this pattern.

The solution follows this pattern by initially setting stars to 1, and spaces to height - 1. 
On each iteration, it outputs a string that includes the appropriate number of spaces and stars. 
It then decrements the number of spaces, and increments the number of stars. This achieves the desired result.

Notice the use of the String.prototype.repeat() method. 
This method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.
