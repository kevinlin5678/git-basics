# Learning Git

Important steps for git workflow:

1. Initialize repository with git init
2. Create changes to project files
3. Check status of those files with git status
4. Stage changes for commit (git add <file name>)
5. Commit changes to version history (git commit -m 'description of commit')
6. Review previous changes with git log
7. Come back and review this list every so often
